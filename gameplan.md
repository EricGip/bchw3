** what we want to make: **

1. App picks a random letter, user has to guess which letter the
app chose.

Text should have:
   1. Guess what letter i'm thinking of
   2. Display number of wins
   3. Display number of losses (# of times user has failed to guess after uses all their tries)
   4. Number of guesses left (that will auto update)
   5. Number of guesses so far (specific letter user typed, resets on wins or losses)
   6. When player wins, increase win counter and start game over again 
   7. When player loses, increase losses conuter and restart the game. 

### Need to initialize variables for wins, losses, guesses
