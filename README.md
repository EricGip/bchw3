The Psychic Game: Guess what letter i'm thinking of. 
Created with JavaScript and BootStrap.
-----------

### The goal of this project was to get familiar with JavaScript and event handlers.

### I'm proud of this project because I was able to recognize that I was repeating code and followed the DRY principle. I cleaned up a lot of messy lines by creating functions!
